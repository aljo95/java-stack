# KTH assignment - Reverse Polish Notation
**<b><u>Assignment</u></b>: Implement reverse Polish notation with a java stack array. Implement with both a static stack size and a dynamic stack size.**

> *In reverse Polish notation, the operators follow their operands. For example, to add 3 and 4 together, the expression is 3 4 + rather than 3 + 4. The expression 3 − 4 + 5 in conventional notation is 3 4 − 5 + in reverse Polish notation: 4 is first subtracted from 3, then 5 is added to it.*
